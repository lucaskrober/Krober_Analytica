# MSc_PhD_Research
This repository contains every Rscript I have created/used during my studies in statistics and data manipulation with R during my PhD and MSc, from 2018 to 2022.
The codes gathered here are examples of hypothesis test, regression analysis, graphical analysis, data manipulation, especially using tidyverse, dplyr and ggplot2 packages.
